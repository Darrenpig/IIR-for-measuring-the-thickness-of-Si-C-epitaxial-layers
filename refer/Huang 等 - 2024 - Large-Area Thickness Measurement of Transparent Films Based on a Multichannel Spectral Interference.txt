Featured Application: Online thickness monitoring of transparent film.
Abstract: Thickness measurement of thin films is essential for quality control in the manufacturing
process of the semiconductor and display industries. Real-time monitoring of film thickness during
production is an urgent technical problem to be solved. In this study, a method for large-area thickness
measurement of transparent films based on a multichannel spectral interference sensor is proposed.
The sensor simultaneously acquires multichannel spectral interference signals through a combination
of fan-out fiber optic bundles, detection probes, and an imaging spectrometer. The spectral data are
calibrated and transformed into the wavenumber dimension, and then the power spectral density
estimation method is used to demodulate the data frequency to swiftly derive the film thickness. The
thickness measurement capacity of the proposed system is successfully validated on two standard
film samples with a relative deviation of less than 0.38% and a relative standard deviation of less than
0.044%. The total spectral acquisition and calculation time for a single multichannel measurement
was approximately 7.5 ms. The experimental results on polyimide films show that the measurement
efficiency of the system is at least 4 times higher than that of the traditional system, indicating the
potential of the multichannel spectral interference sensor for online monitoring in film production.

1. Introduction
Transparent film, as an important industrial component, is widely used in modern
optics, semiconductors, displays, and other related scientific and technological fields [1–3].
The thickness of thin films produced by physical or chemical deposition methods is directly
related to the optical properties, barrier performance, and tensile properties of subsequent
applications [4–6]. However, multiple production factors such as emission characteris￾tics, preparation environment, relative position placement, and surface shape of the plated
parts, might result in uneven thickness distribution, which ultimately affects the product
quality [7–9]. Online film thickness monitoring is thus particularly important for predicting
application effects, modifying process parameters, and improving product quality. Limited
by the irregular production environment and cost, there is an urgent need for a fast, accurate,
and robust online film thickness measurement system.
Non-contact techniques, such as ultrasonic, ray, terahertz, and optical methods, can
be used for online film thickness measurement. Ultrasonic-based technology detects the
thickness of a material by accurately measuring the time of ultrasonic wave propaga￾tion. Commonly used for oil film thickness monitoring, ultrasonic-based thickness mea￾surement technology features a wide measurement range but suffers from low detection
accuracy [10–12]. Ray radiation technology obtains the film thickness by detecting the
attenuation of the ray intensity after penetrating the object. Despite that the ray radiation

methods demonstrate the capacity for high-precision real-time film thickness measurement,
the radioactive sources are expensive and highly hazardous [13–15]. Terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS) utilizes the time-of-flight (TOF) and resonance frequencies to ac￾quire the thickness of the films. THz-TDS is commonly used for thickness measurement of
non-transparent coatings [16–18]. The flaws of the two methods render them unsuitable for
online thickness measurement in film production.
Among various optics-based methods for thickness measurement, including optical re￾flection contrast (ORC), spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), structured illumination microscopy
(SIM), chromatic confocal, optical interferometry, and spectral interferometry, ORC is based
on the film thickness calculation by capturing the reflectance at certain specific wavelengths
with a simple optical configuration. However, for materials with high absorbance, the
detectable thickness range is limited to tens of nanometers due to the saturation of the
reflected signal with increasing thickness [4,19]. SE is a non-destructive, noncontact, and
non-invasive optical technique that is based on the change in the polarization state of light
as it is reflected obliquely from a thin film sample. Despite the capacities of spectroscopic
ellipsometry for measuring the thickness, reflectance, and refractive index of thin films
from sub-micron to nanometer scale [20,21], the application of the technique is limited
by additional measurement time, a small thickness measuring range, and a complicated
structure. SIM can obtain the surface profiles and film thickness by detecting the peaks
of the modulation depth response curves [22,23]. It can detect micrometer-thick films but
cannot be used for industrial inspection due to its slow detection speed. Chromatic confocal
microscopy converts the axial position of the film surface into spectral information through
a confocal pinhole in front of the spectrometer; hence, the measurable thickness range is
restricted by spectral bandwidth and resolution [24]. Based on the principle of optical
interferometry, laser interferometry [25], white light interferometry [26], and differential
interferometry [27] have been developed to achieve nanometer thickness measurement ac￾curacy in the millimeter measurement range. The industrial applications of these methods
are also constrained by the high cost and strict requirements of environmental conditions.
Analyzing the modulation period of the spectral interference fringes, spectral inter￾ferometry calculates thickness, which has the advantage of being simple, nondestructive,
and cost-effective [28–30]. Although its film-measurable thickness range is limited by the
spectral bandwidth and resolution in principle, commercial spectrometers can be used to
measure films in the thickness range of submicron to submillimeter. The thickness mea￾surement accuracy of transparent films is influenced by system parameters and calculation
methods. The major film thickness calculation methods developed using the interference
spectrum include the extremum method [31], envelope method [32], full-spectrum fitting
method [33], and frequency analysis [34]. The extremum method searches for adjacent
spectral peaks corresponding to wavelengths and is easily affected by the accuracy of the
curve fitting. The envelope method and the full-spectrum fitting method depend greatly
on the reflectivity model, rendering them susceptible to non-ideal signals with noise and
distortion of baselines in real-life measurements. The frequency analysis method calculates
the film thickness by extracting the phase information from the high-frequency section of
the spectral signal, thereby filtering out the influence of the light source and ambient light.
This method relies less on the reflectivity model and can obtain thickness with sub-micro
accuracy through a relatively cumbersome calculation process. Benefited by a simple con￾figuration, spectral interferometry poses the potential for industrial thickness measurement
of transparent films. However, limited by accuracy, speed, and a single-point measurement
process, the existing technique is still incapable of large-area thickness measurement of
transparent films during manufacturing.
In this study, a multichannel spectral interference sensor was designed for measuring
large-area and multi-layer thicknesses of transparent films. Linear 1-to-4 fan-out fiber optic
bundles were used to connect multiple probes to the imaging spectrometer. The probes
detected the spectral interference signal of transparent films at a vertical angle and could
be arranged according to the actual location. The film thickness was calculated by fitting

the peak of the power spectral density estimate for the spectral interference signal in the
wavenumber domain. To verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, two
standard film samples of different thicknesses and varieties were employed for testing. The
extremum method and the Fourier frequency transform method were compared with the
proposed method. In addition, experiments on polyimide films demonstrated the real-time
multilayer measurement and thickness imaging capabilities of the proposed method, which
supported its potential application in industrial inspection.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of multiple interferences of the monolayer as illustrated
elsewhere [35,36]. The incident light with an angle of θ1 through the air media with a
refractive index of n0 was reflected at the surface with a reflection coefficient of r01 and
transmitted to the film media of n1 with a transmission coefficient of t01. The incident light
with an angle of θ2 through the film media with a thickness of d was reflected at the surface
of n1–n2 with a reflection coefficient of r12. The reflected light reached the surface of the
air-film, was reflected at the surface with r10, and was transmitted to the air media with t10.
The iteration of the procedure would produce interference from the transparent film. The
spectral intensity changes periodically in the wavelength dimension. The film thickness
can be resolved from the spectral interference signal.

The power spectral density estimate of the spectral interference signal is discrete and
sparse. Limited by the sampling rate of the spectrometer, the minimum frequency interval

converts to an actual thickness of about 30–60 nm. Therefore, there is an inherent error in
extracting film thickness directly by finding the frequency corresponding to the maximum
power spectral density. To further improve the calculation accuracy of film thickness, data
with an amplitude greater than 50% of the peak value of power spectral density were used
to calculate the final film thickness by quadratic linear fitting. Therefore, using the built-in
complete method to calculate the film thickness can greatly eliminate the false-frequency
interference caused by environmental noise and improve the accuracy of the system.
2.3. Hardware Configuration
Figure 3 shows the optical layout and experimental system to simultaneously measure
the thicknesses of multiple points. Considering the measurement principle of spectral
interference, a Tungsten/Halogen lamp (KEWLAB, HLS-1, Melbourne, VIC, Australia),
which covers a wide wavelength range from 360 nm to 2500 nm with a fiber output power
of 5 mW, was used as the light source. An imaging spectrometer (Princeton Instruments,
IsoPlane-160, Teledyne Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ, USA) with camera pixels of
1024 × 1024 was used as a detector. The spectral resolution of the spectrometer is 1.2 nm in
the wavelength range from 440 nm to 850 nm. Therefore, according to Equation (3), the
film thickness measurement range that the proposed system can achieve was calculated at
about 250 nm to 90 µm. A doublet lens with a focal length of 60 mm was used to construct
the detection probe, and the spot size was approximately 1 mm. Linear 1-to-4 fan-out fiber
bundles (Xinrui, SUH600, Shenzhen, China) with a core diameter of 600 µm were used to
connect multiple probes to the imaging spectrometer. In particular, the light collected by
the fiber bundles imaged on the spectrometer slit could be distinguished by the imaging
spectrometer. In the experimental configuration, the slit length was 15 mm, and the slit
width was set to 10 µm to ensure high spectral resolution. While the imaging diameter of
the single fiber core on the spectrometer slit was less than 1 mm, the imaging spectrometer
could be used to measure the film thickness in up to 15 channels. The film thickness
calculation program was run on the MATLAB (R2022b) platform on a personal computer
with an Intel® CoreTM i5-12400F 2.50 GHz processor (Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) and 16.0 GB of memory.

The detailed calculation results of the SiO2 standard film sample by the extremum
method, the Fourier frequency transform method, and the proposed method are shown
in Table 1. The measurement results indicated the mean thickness deviations of these
three methods were −20.48 nm, −81.22 nm, and −2.61 nm, respectively. The measurement
standard deviations of these three methods were 1.65 nm, 0.26 nm, and 0.27 nm, respectively.
Compared with the extremum method and the Fourier frequency transform method,
the proposed method was distinguished by a smaller deviation for film thickness. The
computing time of the proposed method for a single spectrum was about 1.17 ms, which
was longer than that of the other two methods. However, the total measurement and
computing time of the proposed method was approximately 3 ms, which can meet the
needs of online inspection in industrial production.

The detailed measurement results for the two standard film samples are detailed in
Table 2. The certified thickness of the parylene standard film sample is 7166 nm, and the
refractive index is 1.661. The maximum deviations of the multichannel measurement results
of the two films were −2.61 nm and −15.1 nm, while the maximum standard deviations
were 0.30 nm and 1.1 nm, respectively. The results demonstrate that the relative deviation
of the system is less than 0.38%, and the relative standard deviation is less than 0.044%.
Therefore, the proposed method can meet the requirement of thickness measurement
accuracy in film industrial production.

3.2. Thickness Measurement of Polyimide Films
Polyimide films with different thicknesses were used to verify the feasibility of the
system for industrial production measurement. Widely used in electrical and electronic
fields, polyimide is a polymer material with a low dielectric constant, good heat resistance,
and mechanical properties [38–40]. Polyimide film products are made from the gel film
salivated by the polyamide acid resin solution. Subsequent preparation processes include
directional stretching, imidization, and some post-treatment processes. Online thickness
monitoring of polyimide films is related to the quality of subsequent products.
PI films can be divided into electrical-grade and electronic-grade films. We measured
three electronic-grade polyimide films with various thicknesses, as depicted in Figure 6.
The integration time of the spectrometer was set to 3 ms, and other parameters remained
unchanged. The nominal thicknesses of these three films are 3 µm, 8 µm, and 12.5 µm,
respectively. However, the average thicknesses of these films measured 20 times at the
sampling point were 3.3144 µm, 8.2791 µm, and 12.3290 µm, while the standard deviations
were 1.74 nm, 7.89 nm, and 24.17 nm, respectively.
Appl. Sci. 2024, 14, 2816 8 of 12 Appl. Sci. 2024, 14, 2816 8 of 13 
sults of the two films were −2.61 nm and −15.1 nm, while the maximum standard devia￾tions were 0.30 nm and 1.1 nm, respectively. The results demonstrate that the relative de￾viation of the system is less than 0.38%, and the relative standard deviation is less than 
0.044%. Therefore, the proposed method can meet the requirement of thickness measure￾ment accuracy in film industrial production.

3.2. Thickness Measurement of Polyimide Films 
Polyimide films with different thicknesses were used to verify the feasibility of the 
system for industrial production measurement. Widely used in electrical and electronic 
fields, polyimide is a polymer material with a low dielectric constant, good heat resistance, 
and mechanical properties [38–40]. Polyimide film products are made from the gel film

three electronic-grade polyimide films with various thicknesses, as depicted in Figure 6. 
The integration time of the spectrometer was set to 3 ms, and other parameters remained 
unchanged. The nominal thicknesses of these three films are 3 µm, 8 µm, and 12.5 µm, 
respectively. However, the average thicknesses of these films measured 20 times at the

3.3. Multilayer Films Measurement
The proposed system can be further applied to the thickness measurement of multi￾layer films. The three polyimide films mentioned above were combined to produce four
multilayer films. To ensure the signal-to-noise ratio, the integration time of the spectrometer
was set to 5 ms, and other parameters remained unchanged. The spectral interference
signals of multilayer polyimide films are shown in Figure 7a–d. The spectral period change
ceases to follow an intuitive trend with the increase in the number of film layers. Traditional
techniques, such as the extremum method, are no longer feasible for the thickness calcula￾tion of different film layers. The power spectral density derived by the proposed method
is shown in Figure 7e–h. The thickness of the multilayer film can be calculated by fitting
the frequencies corresponding to the peaks of the power spectral density curve. However,
the amplitude of the power spectral density decreases obviously with the increase in the
number of film layers, indicating a limit on the measurable number of film layers. In
addition, as shown in Figure 7e, when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral interference
signal in a certain layer of the multilayer film is low, the power spectral density curve
will be disordered and challenging to fit. The uncertainty of the artificial preparation of
multilayer films may lead to the occurrence of this phenomenon.
The measurement of the above multilayer films was replicated 10 times. The results
detailed in Table 3 demonstrated that the relative standard deviation of the measured mul￾tilayer film thickness was less than 0.16%. In addition, with the increase in the number of
film layers, the measurement accuracy of the film thickness decreased. The large thickness
difference of the same type of film in different combinations indicated poor uniformity of
the artificially prepared multilayer film.

3.3. Multilayer Films Measurement 
The proposed system can be further applied to the thickness measurement of multi￾layer films. The three polyimide films mentioned above were combined to produce four 
multilayer films. To ensure the signal-to-noise ratio, the integration time of the spectrom￾eter was set to 5 ms, and other parameters remained unchanged. The spectral interference 
signals of multilayer polyimide films are shown in Figure 7a–d. The spectral period 
change ceases to follow an intuitive trend with the increase in the number of film layers. 
Traditional techniques, such as the extremum method, are no longer feasible for the thick￾ness calculation of different film layers. The power spectral density derived by the pro￾posed method is shown in Figure 7e–h. The thickness of the multilayer film can be calcu￾lated by fitting the frequencies corresponding to the peaks of the power spectral density 
curve. However, the amplitude of the power spectral density decreases obviously with 
the increase in the number of film layers, indicating a limit on the measurable number of 
film layers. In addition, as shown in Figure 7e, when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spec￾tral interference signal in a certain layer of the multilayer film is low, the power spectral 
density curve will be disordered and challenging to fit. The uncertainty of the artificial 
preparation of multilayer films may lead to the occurrence of this phenomenon.

3.4. Large-Area Thickness Measurement
To verify the large-area thickness measurement capability of the proposed method,
thickness imaging of two polyimide films of different thicknesses was performed using an
XY stage (Thorlabs, MLS203-1, Newton, NJ, USA) with a scanning range of 110 mm × 75 mm.
The scanning area of each channel was 50 × 50 mm2
, while the XY scanning steps were
1.25 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The measurement speed of the proposed system was
4 times that of a traditional single-point thickness measurement system. The total measure￾ment time was limited to 250 s by the spectrometer frame rate of 8 fps. The scanning speed
can be greatly improved by using a spectrometer with a high frame rate camera as the single
spectral acquisition, and the following calculation took only 2 ms and 5.5 ms, respectively.
The thickness distribution of the two polyimide films is shown in Figure 8. The mean
thicknesses of the two films were 7.919 µm and 24.044 µm, respectively. And the standard
deviations were 0.2581 µm and 0.514 µm, respectively. Therefore, the thickness uniformity
of the two films was 3.26% and 2.14%, respectively. The sinusoidal fluctuations in the
thickness of the film indicated room for improvement in the coating process. Additionally,
the observed noise points in the thickness image are related to wrinkles and dust on the
film, and thus, the functionality of the proposed method is also affected by the cleanness of
the working environment. It is necessary to keep the film flat and the environment clean
during online measurement.

(b) 25 µm. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, a multichannel spectral interference sensor for large-area thickness 
measurement of transparent films was proposed. In the optical configuration, linear 1-to-
4 fan-out fiber bundles were used to connect multiple probes to the imaging spectrometer. 
Multichannel signals can be detected synchronously, and the integration time is related to 
the reflectivity of the sample, which is about 2–5 ms. The film thickness measurement 
range that the proposed system can achieve was calculated at about 250 nm to 90 µm. 
Furthermore, a complete method combining the power spectral density estimation algo￾rithm and the quadratic linear fitting algorithm was used to calculate film thickness. Com￾pared with the extremum method and the Fourier frequency transform method, the pro￾posed method was distinguished by a smaller deviation for film thickness. The total meas￾urement and computing time of a single-point film thickness was about 3 ms. 
To verify the thickness measurement performance of the proposed method, two 
standard film samples of different thicknesses and varieties were measured 20 times. The 
results demonstrate that the relative deviation of the system is less than 0.38%, and the 
relative standard deviation is less than 0.044%. In addition, good performance has been 
achieved in the thickness measurement experiment of electronic-grade polyimide films. 
Three different thicknesses of multilayer films were accurately distinguished by just one 
experiment. Furthermore, the large-area thickness measurement speed of the proposed 
system was four times that of a traditional single-point thickness measurement system. 
The large-area thickness measurement experiments revealed the periodic thickness varia￾tion of the film, which may be related to the production parameters. In addition, the noise 
points observed in the thickness images are related to wrinkles and dust on the film. 
Therefore, it is necessary to keep the film flat and the environment clean during online 
measurement. 
Despite that the scanning speed of film thickness imaging was limited to 6 Hz by the 
frame rate of the spectrometer and the step time of the scanning stage, the total time for 
single multichannel spectral acquisition and thickness calculation was successfully re￾duced to 7.5 ms. The measurement speed can be increased by selecting a spectrometer

the probe design to further improve the accuracy of the measurement system.
